## SYNCSHack 2025
Team Name: K Squared

### Situation
This project was made as part of the USYD SYNCS Hackathon for the year 2025. We initially had a great idea but realized, 20 hours in, that it was not feasible to complete within the given time frame. So, we found a way to salvage the parts we could've used like the Google Maps API and decided to make a Random Rest Stop Finder.

### Task/Problem 
Our task was to create a Random Rest Stop Finder using the Google Maps API within an hour. 

### Action
We were able to create the application, however, we failed to deploy it in time. 

### Result
This was actually an interesting experience. It really goes to show that sometimes building on simple ideas is much better than trying to start of with a large one. It also emphasized the importance of collaboration and communicating your ideas properly. Anywho, here is what it looks like.
